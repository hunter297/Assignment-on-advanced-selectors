<p class="paragraph1">GLOBAL WARMING</p>
<p id="paragraph2">Climate change refers to long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural due to changes in the sun's activity or large volcanic eruptions.But since the 1800s,human activities have been the main driver of climate change,primarily due to the burning of fosil fuels like coals oil and gas. burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gases gas emmisions that act like a blanket wrapped around the earth,trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal from heating a building,for example,clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide.Agriculture,oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emmisions.Energy,industry,transport,buildings,agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases. Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years. The average temperature of the Earth surface is now about 1.2degree celcuis warmer than it was late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850. Many people think climate change mainly rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system,where everything is connected,changes in one area can influence changes in all others. The consequences of climate change now include,among others,intense droughts,water scarcity,severe fires,rising sea levels,flooding,melting polar ice,catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>
